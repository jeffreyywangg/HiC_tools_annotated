# Jeffrey's Pointers

A lot of these tools are already dockerized! I would take a look into, at least for the Python tools: 1) making a standard "template" Docker that contains most basic packages, and then 2) installing the new tools into their own Docker image. 

With regard to the specific tools below, I have listed some promising ones to begin with and areas to stray away from: 

- I would not recommend automating pipelines, resolution improvement, normalization, or reproducibility methods. These are data wrangling methods, and not analysis tools. They don't fit much into Superbio's thesis. 
- From there, we have a few broad elements Hi-C analysis: significant interaction callers, loop callers, TAD callers, and compartment callers. 
  - Compartments are definetely the easiest tools to use so demand might be low. I would stray away from implementing these, although I am happy to deploy the [application](https://github.com/ay-lab/dcHiC) I developed for use in Superbio's app store.
  - TAD, loop, and significant interaction callers *are* useful to add. I would recommend some simple Python tools like Mustache, Peakachu, and Fit-Hi-C. 
- 3D feature prediction: ChromHMM is widely popular, [Avocado](https://github.com/jmschrei/avocado) was recently released and becoming popular too. 
- CNV/Translocation callers (niche): HiNT (dockerized), HiCTrans, HiCnv

- [SuperTLD](https://github.com/deepomicslab/SuperTLD) - hierarchical TAD-like domain (TLD) detection from RNA-DNA associated interactions (RAIs, technologies like iMARGI, GRID-seq, ChAR-seq, RADICL-seq). Adapts [SuperTAD](#supertad) by incorporating a Bayesian correction during dynamic programming and iterative inferring hierarchy. Incorporates imputation of missing interaction frequencies using a negative binomial model (inspired by [SAVER](https://github.com/mohuangx/SAVER)). Applied on four RAI datasets, compares TLDs with TADs (Overlapping Ratio (OR) measuring similarity between two hierarchies, normalized mutual information (NMI) measuring similarity of two disjoint partitions (metrics from [SuperTAD](#supertad) paper, four types of TAD relationships (matched, merged, split, shifted, adapted from [SpectralTAD](#spectraltad)), also Pearson correlation and distance decay). TLDs and TADs are moderately similar. RAI-constructed similarity matrices and Hi-C maps are highly correlated, TADs and TLDs are moderately similar, more novel boundaries in TLDs. Common boundaries are associated with cytoplasm and cytosol terms, TLD boundaries - with different terms. <details>

Works across chromosomes (some chromosomes are worse than others) and cell lines (Gm12878, K562, Huvec, Hmec, Nhek, can be used to predict interactions on new cell lines). Selection of the most important features using multi-task group LASSO (distance, CTCF, Tbp, H4K20me1, DNAse, others). Predicted contacts correspond well to the original contacts (distance-stratified Pearson correlation), define TADs similar to the originals (Jaccard), define significant contacts ([Fit-Hi-C](#fit-hi-c)) more enriched in CTCF binding.

#### Micro-C

- Micro-Capture-C (Tiled-MCC, MNase digestion on viewpoints) technology to generate 3C interaction profiles at base-pair resolution. Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells. Local cis-regulatory loops depend on CTCF but not cohesin. Cohesin (RAD21) depletion slightly affects long-range interactions, CTCF depletion leads to rewiring of interactions.

Micro-C, nascent transcript profiling (mNET-seq), live-cell single-molecule imaging (single-particle tracking technique spaSPT. Mouse embryonic stem cells. E-P interaction strength correlates with gene expression, cohesin loop strength does not. E-P and P-P interactions can cross TAD boundaries. TADs are much more effective at insulating cohesin loops than E-P and P-P loops. CTCF depletion had minimal impact on genomewide interactions; RAD21 depletion reduced contact frequency in the range of 10 – 200 kb but increased interactions at 300 kb – 5 Mb; and WAPL depletion increased contacts at 70 – 700 kb but reduced contacts at 1 – 5 Mb. YY1 depletion has minimal effect on gene expression and E-R and P-P interactions.

### Normalization

- Lyu, Hongqiang, Erhu Liu, and Zhifang Wu. "[Comparison of Normalization Methods for Hi-C Data](https://europepmc.org/article/med/31588782) BioTechniques 68, no. 2 (2020) - a comprehensive analysis of six Hi-C normalization methods for their ability to remove systematic biases. The introduction provides a good classification and overview of different normalization methods, including the latest methods for cross-sample normalization, such as [multiHiCcompare](#multihiccompare). Human and mouse Hi-C data were used, only cis interaction matrices are considered. A systematic protocol for benchmarking is presented. Several benchmarks were performed, including statistical quality, the influence of resolution, consistency of distance-dependent changes in interaction frequency, reproducibility of the 3D architecture. [multiHiCcompare](#multihiccompare) is reported as outperforming other methods on a range of performance metrics.
